# Sk8 Site

###This application is a responsive website dedicated to the Powell Peralta brand.

###I built this in week 2 starting with a high fidelity wireframe, I accurately created a responsive website using media queries, HTML, and SASS CSS.

For this project we were given a high definition wireframe design that we were to copy exactly with HTML and SASS CSS as well as make the site fully responsive using media queries and developer tools to test the mobile layout.
